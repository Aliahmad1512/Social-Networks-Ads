# Social-Networks-Ads-CaseStudy
### Our dataset contains some information about all of our users in the social network, including their User ID, Gender, Age, and Estimated Salary. The last column of the dataset is a vector of booleans describing whether or not each individual ended up clicking on the advertisement (0 = False, 1 = True). 

### In the given ‘Social_Network_Ads’, predict which customers are more likely to purchase Social Network Ads. Here, the dependent variable is ‘Purchased’ where 1 = Customer has purchased the Social Network Ad and 0 = Customer has not purchased the Social Network Ad.
